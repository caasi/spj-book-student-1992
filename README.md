# Implementing Functional Languages: a tutorial in Haskell

This is my side-project to implement a Core Language interpreter in Haskell by
following the book: [Implementing Functional Languages: a tutorial][IFL].

[IFL]: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/Papers/pj-lester-book/

I hope I can gain deeper understanding of functional languages after this.
And finish [THE PROJECT][BYOHC] ASAP.
